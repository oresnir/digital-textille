# digital-textille

This project explores new techniques to crochet, combining physical and digital forms.

A crochet pattern is written out so that the crocheter knows which stitches to make, how many to make, and where to make them. A program is lines of code compiled to tell the machine what to do, how many times, and when. In both cases, it is a set of instructions to be executed in a particular order. A crochet pattern is essentially a program; a program is a pattern.

This is a Python-based simulation using Pygame, where the user can control the number of layers, the number of stitches in each layer, and the type of each stitch. It draws a "digital crochet pattern".

To use:

``` pip install -r requirements ```

``` python digital_crochet_basic.py ```

``` python digital_crochet_colors.py ```


the output will be:
